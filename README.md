Project Summary

The Marinduque State University (MarSU) Website Revamp Project aims to enhance the university's online presence by modernizing its website. The project will involve a complete overhaul of the existing site, focusing on user experience (UX), user interface (UI), accessibility, and overall performance. This revamp will ensure the website meets current web standards, is mobile-friendly, and serves as an effective tool for students, faculty, and visitors.

Project Background

The antiquated design and functioning do not satisfy the needs of students, faculty, and prospective students, which harms the university's reputation and operating efficiency. This redesign is crucial for matching the university's online representation with its commitment to high- quality education and services.
