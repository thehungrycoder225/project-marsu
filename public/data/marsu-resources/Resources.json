          "en": "The College of Information and Computing Sciences is one of the premier colleges in the province for IT Education and services. It aims to produce competitive IT professionals and IT-enabled individuals who will encourage real innovation for the advancement in the digital era of the province and the country as a whole.\nThe college was established in 1998 at MSC Boac Campus through BOT Resolution No. 35, s. 1998 as Institute of Information and Computing Sciences (IICS), a special program to offer Associate in Computer Technology (ACT). Believing that the province needs IT Human Resources, after two years, IICS was adopted as the School of Information and Computing Sciences (SICS), offering two emerging degree programs Bachelor of Science in Information Management and Bachelor of Science in Information Technology to cater to the graduates of ACT. Bachelor of Science in Information Management was also offered in Sta. Cruz Campus. The Bachelor of Science in Information Management (BSIM) was renamed to the Bachelor of Science in Information Systems (BSIS) to adapt to CHED Memorandum Order No. 53 series of 2006.\nAfter a decade, the Marinduque State College had an organizational restructuring wherein two of the big schools in the college were merged. The School of Industrial Technology and the School of Information and Computing Sciences convergence paved the way for the School of Technology's birth in 2016. After three years of being together, the two schools parted ways due to another organizational restructuring and SICS was re-birth in 2019.\nIn 2021, however, SICS was converted to the Institute of Information Systems and Technology (IIST) and became part of the College of Engineering, Information and Industrial Technology (CEIIT) together with the Institute of Engineering and Department of Industrial Technology to centralize the resources of these three into a single college. But once again, fate has plans for this institute and let it navigate its ship on its own. Finally, the former school was converted into a college, banning the name of the College of Information and Computing Sciences (CICS).\nIn 25 years of its existence, CICS has contributed significantly to MSC's mandates in Instruction, Research, Extension, and Production. Currently, both the BS in Information Systems and BS in Information Technology in Boac Campus are Level III Re-Accredited by the Accrediting Agency of Chartered Colleges and Universities in the Philippines (AACCUP), while the BS in Information Systems in Sta. Cruz Campus is Level II Re-Accredited. CICS has produced thousands of IT professionals serving in the province, other parts of the country, and even the global industry. Faculty and students are also actively engaged in research through various local and international presentations and publications. CICS also serves the community by providing relevant extension projects and activities.\nFor the years to come, CICS still commits to giving what their stakeholders deserve through quality education and public service with their mantra, 'WORK IN SILENCE AND LET OUR SUCCESS MAKE OUR NOISE!'"
