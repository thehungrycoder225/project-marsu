          "en": "The College of Information and Computing Sciences is one of the premier colleges in the province for IT Education and services. It aims to produce competitive IT professionals and IT-enabled individuals who will encourage real innovation for the advancement in the digital era of the province and the country as a whole.\nThe college was established in 1998 at MSC Boac Campus through BOT Resolution No. 35, s. 1998 as Institute of Information and Computing Sciences (IICS), a special program to offer Associate in Computer Technology (ACT). Believing that the province needs IT Human Resources, after two years, IICS was adopted as the School of Information and Computing Sciences (SICS), offering two emerging degree programs Bachelor of Science in Information Management and Bachelor of Science in Information Technology to cater to the graduates of ACT. Bachelor of Science in Information Management was also offered in Sta. Cruz Campus. The Bachelor of Science in Information Management (BSIM) was renamed to the Bachelor of Science in Information Systems (BSIS) to adapt to CHED Memorandum Order No. 53 series of 2006.\nAfter a decade, the Marinduque State College had an organizational restructuring wherein two of the big schools in the college were merged. The School of Industrial Technology and the School of Information and Computing Sciences convergence paved the way for the School of Technology's birth in 2016. After three years of being together, the two schools parted ways due to another organizational restructuring and SICS was re-birth in 2019.\nIn 2021, however, SICS was converted to the Institute of Information Systems and Technology (IIST) and became part of the College of Engineering, Information and Industrial Technology (CEIIT) together with the Institute of Engineering and Department of Industrial Technology to centralize the resources of these three into a single college. But once again, fate has plans for this institute and let it navigate its ship on its own. Finally, the former school was converted into a college, banning the name of the College of Information and Computing Sciences (CICS).\nIn 25 years of its existence, CICS has contributed significantly to MSC's mandates in Instruction, Research, Extension, and Production. Currently, both the BS in Information Systems and BS in Information Technology in Boac Campus are Level III Re-Accredited by the Accrediting Agency of Chartered Colleges and Universities in the Philippines (AACCUP), while the BS in Information Systems in Sta. Cruz Campus is Level II Re-Accredited. CICS has produced thousands of IT professionals serving in the province, other parts of the country, and even the global industry. Faculty and students are also actively engaged in research through various local and international presentations and publications. CICS also serves the community by providing relevant extension projects and activities.\nFor the years to come, CICS still commits to giving what their stakeholders deserve through quality education and public service with their mantra, 'WORK IN SILENCE AND LET OUR SUCCESS MAKE OUR NOISE!'"

            "en": "It’s never easy to say goodbye to people who helped shape what a team truly means.\nTo our graduates — thank you. You were more than your roles. You were the ones behind the camera, behind the sketches, behind the sound checks. You were there when things got tough, when events popped up out of nowhere, when we had to run from one building to another with barely any rest. You still showed up, even if your house was far, even if your body was tired, even if the weather wasn’t on our side.\nYou captured moments, made people feel seen, and gave meaning to the smallest details. And you didn’t ask for recognition — you simply did what needed to be done, and you did it with heart.\nBarney once said, “𝘞𝘩𝘢𝘵𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘳 𝘺𝘰𝘶 𝘥𝘰 𝘪𝘯 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘭𝘪𝘧𝘦, 𝘪𝘵’𝘴 𝘯𝘰𝘵 𝘭𝘦𝘨𝘦𝘯𝘥𝘢𝘳𝘺 𝘶𝘯𝘭𝘦𝘴𝘴 𝘺𝘰𝘶𝘳 𝘧𝘳𝘪𝘦𝘯𝘥𝘴 𝘢𝘳𝘦 𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘦 𝘵𝘰 𝘴𝘦𝘦 𝘪𝘵.” And we were here to witness it — the late nights, the technical hiccups, the creative rushes, the laughter in between. It wasn’t always perfect, but it was real. It was honest. And it was legendary because you were part of it.\nWe’ve always worked in the moment — live coverage, real-time adjustments, no time for rewrites. And that’s also how this goodbye feels. Sudden. Fast. But meaningful.\nRobin once said, “𝘛𝘩𝘦 𝘧𝘶𝘵𝘶𝘳𝘦 𝘪𝘴 𝘴𝘤𝘢𝘳𝘺, 𝘣𝘶𝘵 𝘺𝘰𝘶 𝘤𝘢𝘯’𝘵 𝘫𝘶𝘴𝘵 𝘳𝘶𝘯 𝘣𝘢𝘤𝘬 𝘵𝘰 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘱𝘢𝘴𝘵 𝘣𝘦𝘤𝘢𝘶𝘴𝘦 𝘪𝘵’𝘴 𝘧𝘢𝘮𝘪𝘭𝘪𝘢𝘳.” And while it’s sad to let go of this chapter, we know you’re ready for what’s next. You’ve already proven how strong, passionate, and reliable you are. And whatever comes after this, we know you’ll carry those same values forward.\nYou’re graduating, but your presence stays with us. In every shoot we do, every layout we polish, every small thing we learned from you — you’ll be there, too.\nFrom all of us still here, thank you for the patience, the guidance, the small talks during long days, and for choosing to stay, even when it was hard.\nYou’ve made your mark. You’ll always be part of our story.\nWith love and pride,\nInfocus Family"
