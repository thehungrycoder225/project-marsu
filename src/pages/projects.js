    conclusion: `The commercialization of arrowroot bagasse/pulp flour leads to full production and utilization of arrowroot bagasse/pulp thus maximizing the use of resources.  An increased market demand for arrowroot bagasse/pulp flour, including its bakery products results to an increased demand for its raw materials, the arrowroot rhizomes. This generates additional income to arrowroot rhizomes processors resulting from the full utilization of rhizomes into arrowroot starch and the production of fiber-enriched flour out of the bagasse/pulp. Consequently, the arrowroot farmers benefit as the buying price for arrowroot rhizomes increase due to the value added.  At the end, all players in the supply chain are benefitted thus leading to a sustainable arrowroot industry in Marinduque.`,

One notable community project led by MarSU’s College of Industrial Technology (CIT) involves technology transfer focused on breadfruit (Rimas) for creating locally sourced food products. MarSU identified Rimas as a valuable resource for food production, utilizing various parts of the tree, including its fruits and seeds, to make flour. In 2017, MarSU-CIT launched free training sessions in Boac, Marinduque, where faculty trained locals in making Rimas-based products to support small businesses and generate income. With MarSU’s initial support through resources and tools, the project enabled participants to establish food businesses. Six years later, an impact study conducted by the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) revealed positive social and economic benefits from the project, highlighting its contribution to sustainable income generation and community improvement.`,

          `To ensure the continued availability and demand for Rimas products, MarSU will engage in ongoing research and training for beneficiaries of this extension project. This training can focus on diversifying the use of Rimas flour in combination with other types of flour, thus extending the supply of this seasonal fruit and opening new market possibilities.`,
          `c.	Collaboration with Local and International Agencies`,
          `MarSU will actively explore partnerships with both local and international agencies, particularly those within the industry, to further support individuals involved in the production of Rimas products. These collaborations can help attract a broader customer base, ensuring the project's sustainability and providing necessary resources for growth.`,

    conclusion: `By implementing these plans, MarSU will contribute to the continuous development and success of Rimas product ventures, benefiting both the local economy and the broader community. In conclusion, the extension project initiated by the College of Industrial Technology on training with Rimas products has proven to be highly beneficial. It has not only enhanced the innovative and entrepreneurial skills of the beneficiaries but also positively impacted their economic status by generating additional income and creating new opportunities within the local community. Furthermore, the project has promoted sustainability by encouraging the long-term use of Rimas as a valuable raw material, benefiting both the individual participants and the broader community. With a focus on SDG 8 and empowerment, MarSU-CIT’s Rimas project is truly “Empowering Minds, Transforming Lives.”`,
