      'The iUgnay Project aims to bridge the digital divide in remote Marinduque villages using satellite technology to provide high-speed internet access and enhance educational and economic opportunities for residents.',
    abstract: `Remote communities in Marinduque face significant barriers to digital connectivity due to their isolated locations and lack of infrastructure. These geographical challenges result in the lack, if not limited, access to reliable internet services, hindering educational opportunities, communication, economic development, and overall digital engagement. Without affordable and consistent internet access, residents are left disconnected from essential resources, unable to participate in online learning, access information, or leverage digital platforms for economic activities.This program bridges the digital divide in remote Marinduque villages using satellite technology by combining Satellite Internet with a CICS-designed Wi-Fi system. It delivers affordable, high-speed connectivity despite geographical challenges. One sample village is in a Marinduque islet of Mongpong at the municipality of Santa Cruz, with over 1,000 residents now has more than 300 individuals accessing the internet, enhancing opportunities for education, communication, and economic growth. The initiative, also serving as an income-generating project, follows a structured approach including planning, network design, installation, testing, and monitoring.Aligned with SDG 4, 9, and 11, the project promotes quality education, builds resilient infrastructure, and fosters sustainable community development. The income generated sustains technology costs, while local DepEd schools and barangays receive free internet access, supporting students in their online learning.`,
    overview: `The project was initiated to address the widespread lack of reliable internet connectivity in Marinduque’s remote locations, where geographical challenges hinder the reach of traditional mobile networks.According to PSA Marinduque, 53.8% or 32,574 households reported that they have access to the Internet. This shows that there are a lot of Marinduqueños who are not connected to the internet, one of the reasons is the high internet cost and internet availability.`,

    description:
      'The project aims to establish a breeder farm, which will be a sustainable and eligible source of quality poultry stocks to be made made available to local farmers to support their livelihoods and improve their income.',
    abstract: `This extension project, which advocates people empowerment and community development, is a
                    response to the call of the Philippine government to accelerate the recovery and restoration of
                    livelihoods from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Poultry production is considered a more
                    viable enterprise for small-holder farmers than other livestock production due to lower capital
                    requirements, high market demand, and shorter production cycles. A free-range chicken production
                    system is regarded as a better poultry enterprise than the conventional, intensive, and caged
                    production system. It provides a conducive growing environment leading to a more humane way of
                    producing poultry. It also utilizes farm resources such as crop residues as feedstuff that are,
                    otherwise, discarded and can cause environmental problems.
                    Despite the advantages of free-range chicken production, it was not yet fully adopted in Marinduque,
                    Philippines. This was due to the limited local supply of quality free-range chicken stocks in the
                    island-province. Sourcing out these farm inputs from the mainland will entail higher production costs,
                    thereby affecting the profitability of the enterprise. Hence, the Marinduque State University
                    Free-range Layer and Broiler Chicken Multiplier Breeder Farm was established through the funding
                    support of the Department of Agriculture - National Livestock Program.
                    Throughout its three years of implementation, the project was able to train 166 farmers and 146
                    students. Fifty-one (31.36%) of the farmer-trainees availed of the stock dispersal program and raised
                    free-range layer chicken and broiler chicken for egg and meat production, respectively. All the
                    students trained received a free-range broiler chicken, which they used for the hands-on activities on
                    chicken dressing during their practicum, internship, and skills development exercises.
                    The project has dispersed 3,373 heads of free-range chicken stocks amounting to Php 629, 385.62
                    or US Dollar 11,020.97 (1 USD = 57.1095 PH). The in-farm and community-based raising of
                    free-range chicken resulted in the total production of 561,730 pieces of table eggs and 1,284.5 kg of
                    dressed chicken. These locally-produced poultry products catered to 2.35% of the provincial demand
                    for table eggs and 0.035% of the need for chicken meat. The project aligns with SDG1: No Poverty,
                    SDG2: Zero Hunger, SDG8: Decent Work and Economic Growth, and SGD12:Responsible
                    Consumption and Production by providing livelihood opportunities to the beneficiaries, promoting
                    sustainable agricultural production, and improving the socio-economic conditions in the province.`,
    overview: `Through poultry raising and production, the extension project is intended to
                    contribute to intensifying the recovery and restoration of the livelihood of
                    local farmers in Marinduque. Marinduque State University (MarSU)

      'The project aims to provide training and development opportunities for barangay officials in Santa Cruz, Marinduque, to enhance their skills and competencies in local governance and administration.',
    abstract: `  It is a program plan designed to underscore the profile of barangay officials in Santa Cruz, Marinduque, one of the six (6) municipalities in the province of Marinduque, consisting of 55 barangays. It addresses how basic services of government are planned and delivered to the people through implementing policies and activities based on developed programs and projects of the community. 
Based on the survey, Punong Barangays are mostly high school graduates (46.1%) who belong in the age bracket of 45-56 (30.8%), and serving their communities for more than six (6) years with 66.6%. Like Punong Barangays, other elected barangay officials and appointed ones with 76.9% had one (1) to three (3) days attendance to training within the locality with 84.6% while 15.4% attended national training due to availability of funds.
Further, 79.49% of barangay officials encountered issues and concerns in barangay management while 89.7% of them prefer personal advancement and professional development for community welfare.  One solution to mitigate the gaps was to conduct training needs assessment among barangay officials.Thus, this program was conceptualized to provide all barangay officials in the 55 barangays of Sta. Cruz to have an access to training and development opportunities necessary to perform their official duties as public servants in the field of barangay administration and local governance.
